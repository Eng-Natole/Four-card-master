## 🛠️ My Process

### Built With

- Semantic **HTML5** markup
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox**
- **Mobile-first workflow**
- **Responsive design**

### 📚 What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned how to:

✔ Use **Flexbox** to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
✔ Apply **CSS custom properties** for consistent styling.
✔ Implement a **mobile-first workflow** to ensure the design looks great on all devices.
✔ Use **media queries** to adjust the layout for larger screens.

#### ✨ Code Snippets

```html
<div class="card-component green">
  <h2>Supervisor</h2>
  <p>Monitors activity to identify project roadblocks</p>
  <svg>...</svg>
</div>
```

```css
.card-component {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  border-top: 5px solid;
  border-radius: 5px;
}

.card-component.green {
  border-color: hsl(180, 62%, 55%);
}
```

### 🔮 Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Enhancing my understanding of **Flexbox** for even more complex layouts.
- Exploring advanced **CSS techniques** like animations and transitions.
- Improving **accessibility** by ensuring all elements are keyboard-navigable and screen-reader-friendly.
